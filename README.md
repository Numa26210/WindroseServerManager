# Windrose Server Manager

**Native desktop manager for [Windrose](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4129620/Windrose_Dedicated_Server/) dedicated servers — with deep [Windrose+](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus) integration for player management, live map, and a configuration editor.**

A Windows desktop app (Avalonia / .NET 9) that bundles SteamCMD setup, server control, configuration editing, mod management, backups, firewall rules, and app-update checks into one clean UI — and adds the full Windrose+ feature stack on top: player list with kick/ban, events log, live map, health checks and Windrose+ update notifications.

> **This is a community fork** of [ManuelStaggl/WindroseServerManager](https://github.com/ManuelStaggl/WindroseServerManager), actively maintained by [Numa26210](https://github.com/Numa26210) with additional features and security fixes.

**Status: Stable · v1.6.0**

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.6.0-success)
![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-235%20passing-brightgreen)

> The UI ships in **English and German** with auto-detection from the Windows language setting.

## What's new in v1.5.0

### 🔒 Security Fixes
- **RCON command injection prevention** — kick/ban/broadcast parameters are now sanitized (strips `\n`, `\r`, `\0`) to prevent arbitrary command injection
- **PowerShell script integrity** — SHA-256 verification of PS1 scripts before execution (install.ps1, BuildPak, dashboard)
- **Strict digest enforcement** — installation now fails when the publisher SHA-256 digest is missing (was a warning, now a hard failure)
- **Correct Windrose+ release URL** — updated to `github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus`

### ⚡ Performance Fixes
- **Deadlock fix in RestartScheduler** — `CheckAutoRestartThresholds` converted to `async Task` with proper `await`
- **HttpClient reuse** — single reusable `_loginClient` instance instead of `new HttpClient()` per request
- **Async session management** — `_sessionLock.Wait()` replaced with `await _sessionLock.WaitAsync()`

### ✅ Test Coverage
- **215 passing tests** (up from 151 in v1.2.x, +64 new)
- **BackupService** — 22 tests (create/restore/delete/retention, safety snapshot, partial cleanup)
- **ServerConfigService** — 25 tests (load/save/delete, atomic write, envelope preservation, edge cases)
- **ServerEventLog** — 9 tests (append/read/clear, corruption resilience, 50-writer concurrency)
- **RCON sanitization** — 8 tests

## What's new in v1.6.0

### 🔧 Windrose+ Quality of Life
- **Toggle on/off without reinstalling** — enable/disable Windrose+ per server without losing installed files
- **Version pinning** — choose a specific Windrose+ release from a dropdown; "(Latest)" tracks the newest automatically
- **QoL Editor** — 10 categorized multiplier sliders (XP, loot, stack size, weight, etc.) with save/reset and conflict detection
- **Mod conflict scanner** — automatic detection of conflicting mods with per-card warnings and editor banner

### 💾 Per-Server Folders
- Configure backup and mods directories per server via Settings UI with folder picker
- Falls back to global defaults when override is not set — fully backward compatible

### 🖥️ System Tray Improvements
- **Close to tray** — toggle in Settings to minimize to tray on window close instead of quitting
- **Start minimized** — `--tray` / `--minimized` flag now fully hides the main window at startup
- Tray "Quit" always fully exits, regardless of CloseToTray setting

### ✅ Test Coverage
- **235 passing tests** (up from 215 in v1.5.0, +20 new)
- Per-server folder overrides — 4 tests
- CloseToTray setting — 3 tests
- Windrose+ toggle behavior — 3 tests
- Version pinning — 1 test

## What's new in v1.3.0

### 🤖 Integrated Discord Bot
A fully integrated Discord bot running as a background service alongside the Avalonia UI.

- Bot comes **online automatically** when the application starts and goes offline on close
- **Live server status** displayed as the bot's Discord Activity (e.g. "🟢 Server online (uptime: 2h 30m)")
- **Session history events** forwarded in real-time to a configurable Discord channel
- **Slash commands** (all restricted to Discord Server Administrators):
  - `/status` — Shows server status, uptime and RAM usage via a styled Embed
  - `/start` / `/stop` / `/restart` — Remote server control
  - `/backup` — Creates a manual backup
  - `/backuprestart` — Stops the server, creates a clean backup, then restarts
  - `/update` — Updates the server via SteamCMD with live progress editing
- Configure the bot directly from the **Settings** page (Token, Guild ID, Log Channel ID)

### 💾 Backup on Restart
- New option in **Server Control** to automatically create a backup before every scheduled or threshold-based restart
- Backup is created after the server stops and before it starts again, guaranteeing files are never locked during archiving
- A backup failure never blocks the server restart

### 🔧 Server Update Reliability
- Fixed critical bug: SteamCMD non-zero exit code is now correctly reported as a failure
- Added Cancel button for in-progress updates
- Extended SteamCMD error detection patterns
- Real-time bootstrap logs during SteamCMD self-update phase
- UI progress now syncs correctly whether the update is triggered from the UI or from Discord

---

## Built on Windrose+

The headline feature in v1.2.0 — and most of the player-management UI you'll see in this manager — is powered by **[Windrose+](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus)**, an MIT-licensed mod by **HumanGenome** that adds the HTTP API, RCON, events log, and live map that Windrose itself doesn't expose.

The manager just provides a friendly UI on top: the install wizard offers Windrose+ during server setup, you click yes, and everything below works — no manual mod install, no JSON editing, no RCON-password juggling.

If you'd rather stay vanilla, **Windrose+ is fully optional**. Every WindrosePlus-powered view shows an empty state explaining what you'd unlock if you opted in. You can also enable it later from Settings or via a one-click banner on existing servers.

A huge thank-you to **HumanGenome** for building Windrose+, keeping the API stable, and explicitly green-lighting this integration. Please [star the Windrose+ repo](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus) — they're doing the heavy lifting.

## Features

### 🤖 Discord Bot Integration *(v1.3.0+)*
- Bot runs as a background service — starts and stops with the app
- Live server status as Discord Activity
- Session history events forwarded to a configurable Discord channel
- Slash commands: `/status`, `/start`, `/stop`, `/restart`, `/backup`, `/backuprestart`, `/update`
- All critical commands restricted to Discord Server Administrators
- Configure Token, Guild ID and Log Channel ID directly from Settings

### Player management (with Windrose+)
- **Player list** — see who's online, with one-click **kick**, **ban** and **broadcast**.
- **Events log** — every join and leave with timestamps and a live filter.
- **Live map** — opens in your browser, shows real-time player positions on the world.
- **Configuration editor** — XP rates, loot multipliers, RCON, harvest yields, all grouped and validated. No more hand-editing JSON.
- **Health banner** on the dashboard if something is wrong, with a one-click "Report" button that prefills a Windrose+ GitHub issue with the right context.
- **Update checks** for new Windrose+ releases, with one-click update for one or all servers.

### Multi-server support
- Manage as many Windrose servers as you want from one app.
- Each server gets its own card on the Server page with start/stop, open-folder, jump-to-live-map, auto-start toggle.
- Per-server config, RCON password, port and state — fully isolated.

### Server installation & adoption
- **Fresh install via SteamCMD** (App-ID `4129620`, anonymous login) with live download progress.
- **Adopt an existing install** — point the wizard at a folder where you already installed Windrose via SteamCMD, and it skips the download and just registers the server.
- Path validation (no UNC, no Program Files, no special chars).
- Update check via Steam build ID.
- Safeguards: no double-registering the same folder, no overwriting Windrose+ while a server is running.

### Server control & automation
- **Start / Graceful-Stop / Force-Kill / Restart**
- **Auto-restart on crash** (opt-in)
- **Scheduled restarts** per weekday with configurable warning toast
- **Threshold-based restarts** — high RAM usage or max uptime
- **Backup on restart** *(v1.3.0)* — automatic backup before every restart
- **Session history** of all starts / stops / crashes with duration
- **Live log** with colour coding (errors red, warnings orange)

### Configuration
- Form-based editor for `ServerDescription.json` and `WorldDescription.json`
- Manage multiple worlds (create, activate, delete)
- Invite code generator (re-roll)
- World parameters (difficulty, mob health/damage, ship stats, …)
- Password protection with masked input

### Mod management
- **Drag & drop** install from `.pak`, `.zip`, or `.7z` (7z via SharpCompress)
- **Automatic grouping** — mods coming from a single archive appear as one expandable mod card
- **Enable/disable** via `.pak` ↔ `.pak.disabled` rename (companion `.ucas`/`.utoc` files move with it)
- **"Open on Nexus"** link for any mod whose Nexus ID was auto-detected from the archive filename or linked manually

### Backups
- One-click backup of `ServerDescription.json` + worlds + mods
- Scheduled backups (daily / weekly)
- **Backup on restart** — automatic backup triggered before every scheduled or threshold-based restart
- Safe-restore preview before overwriting
- Configurable retention

### System integration
- Tray icon with quick start/stop
- Windows firewall rule (`netsh advfirewall`, prompts for admin)
- HKCU Run-Key autostart
- App self-update via GitHub Releases (manual install)
- Optional console-log launch arg

### Design
- Native dark UI (Avalonia 12 + Semi.Avalonia + custom navy/amber brand layer)
- Maritime/pirate flavour, but functional first
- Mica backdrop on Windows 11
- Custom window chrome with Windows 11 rounded corners

## First Run

1. **Dashboard** opens with an onboarding card.
2. **Server** → "Add server" → pick a folder.
   - Empty folder → fresh install via SteamCMD.
   - Folder already contains a Windrose install → wizard adopts it (no download).
3. **Windrose+ opt-in step** → keep the default ("Install Windrose+") for the full feature set, or skip if you want vanilla.
4. **Server Control** → "Start".
5. **Settings** → add firewall rule (accept admin prompt).

## Nexus Mods — How linking works

The app **does not talk to the Nexus API**. It does not store an API key, does not download mods for you, and does not poll Nexus for updates. Mods are always downloaded manually from nexusmods.com — that is the normal Nexus workflow.

What the app *does* do:

- When you drop a Nexus download archive onto the Mods page, the mod ID is extracted from the filename (Nexus's standard naming pattern: `Name-{modId}-{version}-{timestamp}.zip`) and remembered next to the installed `.pak` in a small side-car `.pak.meta.json` file.
- A **"Open on Nexus"** button on each linked mod card jumps straight to `https://www.nexusmods.com/windrose/mods/{id}` in your browser. That's the single network touch — and it's just launching a URL.
- You can also link any installed mod manually by pasting a Nexus URL or mod ID.

To check whether a mod has an update: click "Open on Nexus" and look at the page. The app will not nag you.
